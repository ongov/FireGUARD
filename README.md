# About FireGUARD

## Overview

FireGUARD (Fire Growth under Uncertainty for Appropriate Response Decision Support) is designed to support wildland fire response decicion-making. FireGUARD contains four core elements:

1. generation of weather forecast scenarios
2. generation of a burn probability map from replicated simulation of fire growth, smouldering, and natural extinction under the weather scenarios and stochastic fire behaviour scenarios
3. assessment of 'risk' (i.e., likelihood-weighted impacts) by multiplying the spatial burn probability by a spatial rating of potential socio-economic impact, and
4. (in progress for future implementation) estimation of the cost of response alternatives

## Additional License Condition

All covered works (e.g., copies of this work, derived works) must include a copy of the file (or an updated version of it) that details credits for work up to the time of the original open source release. That file is available [here](ORIGIN.md).
